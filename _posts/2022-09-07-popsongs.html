<p>
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
</p>

<p>
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
</p>

<p>
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
</p>


<p>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
</p>

<p>
Because I'm easy come, easy go
</p>

<p>
Little high, little low
</p>

<p>
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
</p>


<p>
Mama, just killed a man
</p>

<p>
Put a gun against his head
</p>

<p>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
</p>

<p>
Mama, life had just begun
</p>

<p>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
</p>


<p>
Mama, ooh
</p>

<p>
Didn't mean to make you cry
</p>

<p>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
</p>

<p>
Carry on, carry on
</p>

<p>
As if nothing really matters
</p>


<p>
Too late, my time has come
</p>

<p>
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
</p>

<p>
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
</p>

<p>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
</p>


<p>
Mama, oooh (Anyway the wind blows)
</p>

<p>
I don't wanna die
</p>

<p>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
</p>



<p>
I see a little silhouetto of a man
</p>

<p>
Scaramouch[9], Scaramouch,
</p>

<p>
Will you do the fandango[10]?
</p>

<p>
Thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening me
</p>

<p>
Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo,
</p>

<p>
Galileo, Figaro, Magnifico oh oh oh
</p>

<p>
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
</p>

<p>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
</p>

<p>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
</p>

<p>
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
</p>

<p>
Bismillah![14][15] No, we will not let you go (Let him go)
</p>

<p>
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go)
</p>

<p>
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go)
</p>

<p>
Will not let you go - Let me go (Never)
</p>

<p>
Will not let you go - Let me go (Never, Never, Never)
</p>

<p>
Oh oh oh
</p>

<p>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
</p>

<p>
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia,
</p>

<p>
Mamma mia, let me go
</p>

<p>
Beelzebub has the devil put aside for me
</p>

<p>
for me, for me[17]
</p>



<p>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
</p>

<p>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?[18]
</p>

<p>
Oh baby, can't do this to me, baby
</p>

<p>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
</p>



<p>
Ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh
Nothing really matters
</p>

<p>
Anyone can see
</p>

<p>
Nothing really matters
</p>

<p>
Nothing really matters to me
</p>

<p>
Any way the wind blows
</p>
